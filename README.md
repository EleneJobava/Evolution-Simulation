# Evolution Simulation - Design Patterns in Python

A creature evolution and combat simulation demonstrating clean OOP design and design patterns.

## Design Patterns Used

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different movement behaviors (Crawl, Hop, Walk, Run, Fly)
- **Decorator Pattern**: Evolving creature abilities (Claws, Teeth, Wings)
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating randomized creatures

## Architecture Highlights

- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to extend with new creature abilities
- SOLID principles throughout
- Type-safe with mypy
- Formatted with ruff

## Technologies

- Python 3.13
- Static type checking (mypy)
- Code formatting (ruff)
